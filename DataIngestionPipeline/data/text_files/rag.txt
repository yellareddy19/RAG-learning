Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced framework in artificial intelligence that combines information retrieval with generative modeling to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
It bridges the gap between traditional search systems and generative models by integrating external knowledge sources into the generation process.
Instead of relying only on pre-trained parameters of a large language model, RAG actively queries a knowledge base or vector database during inference.
This allows it to bring in the most up-to-date and domain-specific information that the model may not have memorized.
The architecture typically involves two main components: a retriever and a generator.
The retriever searches external documents, embeddings, or indexed corpora to fetch the most relevant passages.
The generator then conditions on both the query and the retrieved content to create a coherent and factually grounded answer.
This process ensures that the model is less prone to hallucinations and misinformation.
RAG is widely used in building enterprise chatbots, customer support systems, and domain-specific assistants.
For example, in healthcare, it can access electronic health records or medical literature to provide compliance-friendly and accurate responses.
In finance, it can pull the latest regulations or market data before generating recommendations.
The retriever can be powered by dense vector embeddings using models like DPR or sentence-transformers.
The generator is often a large language model such as BERT, GPT, or T5 adapted for conditioned text generation.
RAG also supports multi-turn conversations by maintaining retrieval memory across queries.
Its modular design allows organizations to plug in different retrieval systems or update knowledge bases without retraining the generator.
This makes RAG more scalable and adaptive compared to static models.
It also enhances transparency, as the retrieved sources can be displayed to justify the generated outputs.
Recent advancements combine RAG with multi-agent systems and LangChain pipelines for orchestration.
Overall, RAG represents a key step toward trustworthy, knowledge-grounded AI.
It enables real-world deployment of generative models where accuracy, explainability, and compliance are critical.
