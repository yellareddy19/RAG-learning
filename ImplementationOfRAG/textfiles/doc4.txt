Fire is both a life-giving and destructive force. It provides warmth, light, and a means to cook food, marking one of humanity’s greatest discoveries. However, when uncontrolled, fire can cause immense damage to forests, homes, and lives. In nature, fire also plays a role in regeneration, helping certain plants release seeds and recycle nutrients.
            Understanding and respecting fire’s dual nature is key to using it safely and wisely.
