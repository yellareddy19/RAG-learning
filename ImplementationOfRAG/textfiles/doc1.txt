Animals play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by forming interconnected food chains. From insects that pollinate crops to predators that control populations, each species contributes to the health of ecosystems. They also provide companionship, work assistance, and inspiration to humans. Protecting wildlife is essential,
        not only for biodiversity but also for ensuring the stability of natural environments that sustain all life.
